# personal-projects
Personal projects of mine where I find databases on Github or on Keggle and try to observe trends and relationships within the data, display them on a graph and even make 
some models to predict some aspects of the database.
This is where I try to practice my database managing skills, data representation skills and my scikit-learn skills.
