Extracted data from the excel file in the same folder here and tried to find trends and relationships between different factors in the database. Made several graphs to display 
multiple potential relationships between different columns in the database.

In the end a model was made that would predict if the students have or have no taken the exam preparation course based on the student's other factors in the database. 
2 models were developed, a K nearest neighbors model and a model using logistic regression.

All the results from messing with the database, graphs and the learning models are shown in the notebook and taked about for a bit.
